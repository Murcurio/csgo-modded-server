## Maps

You need to source your own maps and update `csgo/mapcycle_*` to match your maps.

### Download maps

```
# cd to "csgo" parent directory so you are in the same folder as srcds
cd /home/steam/csgo/
curl --silent --output "automate.sh" "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kus/csgo-modded-server-assets/master/automate.sh" && chmod +x automate.sh && bash automate.sh
```

## Fast DL

By default the download limit of CS:GO is capped at 20kb/s and also adds additional strain to servers if multiple clients are downloading files at the same time on map changes.

[sv_downloadurl](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Sv_downloadurl) allows CS:GO clients to get custom server content (maps/sounds etc) at high speeds from web servers using HTTP which also takes the strain off the game server.

A [bash script](https://github.com/kus/csgo-modded-server/blob/master/scripts/bzip.sh) is included to make this process easy and automatically create the correct directory structure and compress your files with [bzip2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzip2) and create a "fastdl" folder which you simply host on a webserver and set your `FAST_DL_URL` on your server to something like `http://yoursite.com/fastdl/csgo`.

Windows users can [download this](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bzip2.htm) and manually create the directory structure and compress the files. Anything in `maps`, `sounds`, `materials`, `models` and you need to keep the same directory structure. You should end up with something like:

```
fastdl
-csgo
--maps
--sounds
--materials
--models
```

If you want to use my bundled maps and this server setup you can use `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kus/csgo-modded-server-assets/master/csgo` for your `FAST_DL_URL` linux environment variable or `sv_downloadurl` in `cfg/env.cfg` for Windows. Make sure you change `sv_allowdownload` to `0`.

## Updating Metamod/SourceMod

Periodically CS:GO will release updates which break Metamod:Source and SourceMod (the server won't start), and they will patch for the updates and release new updates. These need to be applied for the server to run properly. I will try to keep them up to date here which your server will automatically download if using my Linux gcp script but in the case I haven't updated them you can update them your self by checking the version I have bundled above and downloading the latest and putting on your server manually.

### SourceMod

[Download](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php?branch=stable) Linux and Window and in each folder do the following:

From `/addons/sourcemod/` copy `bin`, `extensions`, `gamedata`, `sripting`, `translations` to your servers `/addons/sourcemod/` and *Merge All*

### Metamod:Source

[Download](http://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.php?branch=stable) Linux and Window and in each folder do the following:

From `/addons/metamod/` copy `bin` to your servers `/addons/metamod/` and *Merge All*

## Acessing admin menu

Bind a key to `sm_admin` from console i.e. `bind p sm_admin` then press `p` and the admin menu should open.

If you want to add admins, you need to edit this file `/addons/sourcemod/configs/admins_simple.ini` and add the admin to the bottom i.e. `"STEAM_0:0:56050"	"9:z"` save the file and if the server is running run `sm_reloadadmins` and reconnect to the server.

If you want to read more about admin flags you can do that [here](https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Adding_Admins_(SourceMod)).

Note: `/addons/sourcemod/configs/admins_simple.ini` will be overwritten by my script defaultly each time `install.sh` runs so once you have `install.sh` on your server you may want to update `gcp.sh` and comment out the `curl` line which downloads the latest `install.sh` as it shouldn't change too much.

Open `install.sh` and after it dynamically creates `cfg/env.cfg` you there is commented out code that will dynamically overwrite `/addons/sourcemod/configs/admins_simple.ini` with your own admins. Simply update the Steam ID's and uncomment the lines.

## Changing game modes

Once you are setup as an admin, open up the admin menu and go to Server Commands > Exec Configs and choose a game mode i.e. "Competitive" and you need to change the map for it to properly kick in so open the admin menu again and Server Commands > Maps > de_dust2 and once the server changes map the new game mode will be running.

## Making changes to WarMod plugin

You need [SourceMod 1.8](http://sourcemod.net/downloads.php?all=1&branch=1.8-dev) to compile and add the following into `addons/sourcemod/scripting/includes` [tEasyFTP.inc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thraaawn/tEasyFTP/master/scripting/include/tEasyFTP.inc) [bzip2.inc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thraaawn/SMbz2/master/pawn/scripting/include/bzip2.inc) [updater.inc](https://bitbucket.org/GoD_Tony/updater/raw/12181277db77d6117052b8ddf5810c7681745156/include/updater.inc) [zip.inc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Versatile-BFG/sm-zip/master/sm-zip/scripting/include/zip.inc) and copy the compiled `warmod.smx` from `addons/sourcemod/scripting/compiled` to `addons/sourcemod/plugins/disabled`.

```

* **If running for the first time**

   Once the CS:GO server has started close it

   Copy your maps to `/home/steam/csgo/csgo/maps/` or you can use my [bundled maps](#download-maps)

   If you want to use my bundled maps and this server setup you can use `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kus/csgo-modded-server-assets/master/csgo` for your `FAST_DL_URL` linux environment variable.

   Update each `/csgo/mapcycle_` file to match your maps

   Open `/install.sh` and after it dynamically creates `cfg/env.cfg` you there is commented out code that will dynamically overwrite `/addons/sourcemod/configs/admins_simple.ini` with your own admins. Simply update the Steam ID's and uncomment the lines.

   Run `./install.sh` again

When you join the server you can [change game modes](#changing-game-modes).

## Running on Windows
Make sure you have **25GB free space**.

[Download this repo](https://github.com/kus/csgo-modded-server/archive/master.zip) and extract it to where you want your server (i.e. `C:\Server\csgo-modded-server`). All the following instructions will use this as the root.

Create a folder `steamcmd` and [download SteamCMD](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/steamcmd.zip) and extract it inside `steamcmd` so you should have `\steamcmd\steamcmd.exe`.

* **If setting up internet server:**

   Open `\csgo\cfg\env.cfg`

   Set `sv_setsteamaccount` to your [Game Server Login Token](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers)

   Open `\win.ini`

   Set `ip_internet` to your [public ip](http://checkip.amazonaws.com/)

* **If setting up LAN server:**

   Open `\csgo\cfg\env.cfg`

   Set `sv_lan` to `1`

[Add admins](#acessing-admin-menu)

Run `win.bat`

* **If running for the first time**

   Once the CS:GO server has started close it

   Copy your maps to `\server\csgo\maps\` or you can use my [bundled maps](#download-maps) (you need to unzip them all)

   If you want to use my bundled maps and this server setup you can use `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kus/csgo-modded-server-assets/master/csgo` for your your `sv_downloadurl` in `cfg/env.cfg`. Make sure you change `sv_allowdownload` to `0`.

   Update each `\csgo\mapcycle_` file to match your maps

   Run `win.bat` again

When you join the server you can [change game modes](#changing-game-modes).

## How do I connect to RCON remotely?
[Download SourceAdminTool](https://users.alliedmods.net/~drifter/SAT/) for your OS (you can read about it [here](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=289370)) and click `Servers > Add Servers` and put in the `<IP>:27015` and when you see the server show in the list, down the bottom left type in your RCON password and click `Login` and you should be able to execute commands from the bottom text box i.e. `exec gg.cfg`

## FAQ

### Why can't I set the server to start automatically with a mod loaded
Because the way the server is setup with several mods it's not possible. You can't use +exec in the server launcher as that executes to quick before SourceMod is loaded. You can monitor the server once it's started (via RCON) and then load a mod i.e. `exec gg.cfg` then `changelevel ar_shoots`.

It would need a custom plguin that once the first map has loaded, it would execute a mod.cfg delayed and then change the map with a slight delay.

### Why can't I set when a mod is loaded that it changes map
I tried this, and it happens too fast before the mods are fully loaded. If there was a way to delay the map change command that would work.
